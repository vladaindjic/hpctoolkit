@settitle Current Spack Issues for HPCToolkit

@section Introduction

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.

Report problems to @code{hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu}.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
@code{packages.yaml} file in the @code{spack} subdirectory of the
hpctoolkit repository.  And always check the latest version of this file
on the hpctoolkit web site.

@section Recently Resolved Issues

@subsection (2019-06-06) intel-xed and hpcviewer

Packages that use a spack resource (a second tar file) are currently
broken.  This includes intel-xed (x86_64 only) and hpcviewer (all
platforms).

@noindent
@b{Fixed:} This is now fixed in spack develop in commit
@code{aca1bfdb6a64} on 2019-06-13.

@section General Problems

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

@subsection Unable to fetch

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

@example
==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5
@end example

@noindent
This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

@subsection New version breaks the build

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

@subsection Spack core breaks the build

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some @code{package.py} file.  The solution is to look
through the spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit
before the breakage.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@section Long Term Issues

@subsection Boost 1.68.0

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

@subsection Elfutils 0.176

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for @code{aligned_alloc})
and won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and
Blue Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.
