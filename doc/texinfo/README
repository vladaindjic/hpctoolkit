This directory replaces some of the *.html.in files in ../www/ with
texinfo files.  For now, only the build and install directions from
software-instructions.html.  The advantage of texinfo is that it is
possible to produce text, html and latex output (almost anything) from
a single source.  This works well for directions that are mostly text.

Requirements: texinfo (makeinfo) version 6.x or later, and perl
version 5.x or later.  Texinfo is available as a spack package and
builds simply and robustly with no prerequisites other than perl.

Update the .html files in two phases.  First, outside of the normal
build for hpctoolkit, edit the .texi files in this directory and use
'make install' to copy them to the ../www/ directory.  Then, the
normal 'make install' for hpctoolkit will copy them to the install
prefix (in share/doc/hpctoolkit).

  1. edit the .texi files with a text editor.

  2. make (in this directory) -- this uses makeinfo to convert .texi
  to html.

  3. make install (this directory) -- this copies the .html files to
  the ../www/ directory.

  4. make install (for hpctoolkit) -- this copies the .html files to
  the install prefix.

Note: you don't need to rerun hpctoolkit configure after editing the
texinfo files, just make install.

Note: only developers editing the documentation ever need to run these
steps.  The .html files are generated from texinfo and we keep the
generated version in the repository.  This means that normal users who
clone hpctoolkit already have the generated files and 'make install'
for hpctoolkit will copy them to the install directory.
