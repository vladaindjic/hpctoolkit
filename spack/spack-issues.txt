1 Introduction
==============

Spack is a moving target and receives multiple commits per day.
Normally, HPCToolkit will build and run successfully with the latest
version of all of its prerequisite packages, but sometimes not.  This
page covers the current known issues where HPCToolkit fails to build
with the latest version of spack.

   Report problems to 'hpctoolkit-forum at rice dot edu'.  But before
reporting a problem, first try the versions recommended in the
'packages.yaml' file in the 'spack' subdirectory of the hpctoolkit
repository.  And always check the latest version of this file on the
hpctoolkit web site.

2 Current Issues
================

No known issues at this time.

3 Recently Resolved Issues
==========================

3.1 (2019-06-06) intel-xed and hpcviewer
----------------------------------------

Packages that use a spack resource (a second tar file) are currently
broken.  This includes intel-xed (x86_64 only) and hpcviewer (all
platforms).

Fixed: This is now fixed in spack develop in commit 'aca1bfdb6a64' on
2019-06-13.

4 General Problems
==================

These are general problems that arise from time to time.

4.1 Unable to fetch
-------------------

Sometimes spack fails to download the source file(s) for some package
and dies with a message similar to this.

     ==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/m4/m4-1.4.18.tar.gz failed.
     ==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for m4-1.4.18-vorbvkcjfac43b7vuswsvnm6xe7w7or5

This problem is usually temporary and the solution is to either wait a
few minutes or an hour and try again, or else download the file manually
and put it into a spack mirror.

4.2 New version breaks the build
--------------------------------

Sometimes the latest version of some package breaks the build.  This has
happened a couple of times where a new version of Boost has broken the
build for Dyninst.  The solution is to revert the package to an earlier
version until the rest of the code catches up.

4.3 Spack core breaks the build
-------------------------------

Sometimes but rarely, something in the spack core will change or break
the code in some 'package.py' file.  The solution is to look through the
spack git log and revert the repository to a recent commit before the
breakage.

5 Long Term Issues
==================

5.1 Boost 1.68.0
----------------

Avoid boost version 1.68.0, it breaks the build for hpctoolkit.  Version
1.70.0 works with the latest version of dyninst (10.1.0), or else 1.66.0
is good and works with all versions of dyninst.

5.2 Elfutils 0.176
------------------

Elfutils 0.176 requires glibc 2.16 or later (for 'aligned_alloc') and
won't work with an older glibc, including RedHat or CentOS 6.x and Blue
Gene.  On systems with an old glibc, use version 0.175.
